# 'make depend' uses makedepend to automatically generate dependencies 
#               (dependencies are added to end of Makefile)
# 'make'        build executable file 'mycc'
# 'make clean'  removes all .o and executable files
#

# define the C/C++ compiler to use,default here is clang
CC ?= clang

# define compile-time flags NOTE: last two flags required for C++ 11 spec on osx
CFLAGS = -g -Wall

# define any directories containing header files other than /usr/include
INCLUDES = -I/usr/local/include

# define library paths in addition to /usr/lib
#   if I wanted to include libraries not in /usr/lib specify
#   their path using -Lpath, something like:
LFLAGS = -L/usr/local/lib

# define any libraries to link into executable:
#   To ling libusb-1.0 :
#   LIBS = -lusb-1.0
LIBS = 

# define the source files, default here is main.cpp
SRCS = test.c

# define the object files 
#
# This uses Suffix Replacement within a macro:
#   $(name:string1=string2)
#         For each word in 'name' replace 'string1' with 'string2'
# Below we are replacing the suffix .c of all words in the macro SRCS
# with the .o suffix
#
OBJS = $(SRCS:.c=.o)

# define the executable file  name
MAIN = test

#
# The following part of the makefile is generic; it can be used to 
# build any executable just by changing the definitions above and by
# deleting dependencies appended to the file from 'make depend'
